      <p>
        From the moment I met you, you’ve filled my life with laughter, warmth,
        and endless joy. Your smile is my daily sunrise, and your love is the
        melody that keeps my heart dancing. On this special day, I want you to
        know that you’re my everything—and I’m so grateful for every second we
        share. Happy birthday, my love! May your day be as bright and beautiful
        as you make my world.

        I’m so sorry I didn’t wish you right at midnight. You mean the world to
        me, and the only reason I missed it was because I was dreaming of all the
        amazing moments we’ll create today. Please forgive me, and let’s make
        this birthday unforgettable—starting now!
